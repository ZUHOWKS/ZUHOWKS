# üëã Hi there !
Hello, I'm **Joris**, currently a DevOps student at Polytech Montpellier. I'm passionate about automated systems, cutting-edge technologies, and building robust, scalable infrastructure to streamline development and deployment processes.

I thrive on projects where **quality**, **automation**, and **performance** meet. My core motivation lies in crafting elegant tool experiences and automating repetitive tasks ‚Äî because engineers should focus on **innovation**, not boilerplate.

Currently:
- ‚öôÔ∏è Working on internal tooling and infrastructure automation at **Hardis Group**
- üõ† Designing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines with **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and container orchestration
- üì¶ Developing full-stack solutions with **Rust**, **TypeScript**, and **Dart**
- üìö Continuously improving my technical writing and communication ‚Äî both in **French** and **English**

## What languages do I use ?
I mainly use **Rust**, **TypeScript**, and **Dart**, each contributing to my ability to build safe, performant, and maintainable systems.

- **TypeScript** is my foundation for building expressive web apps and APIs. I especially enjoy working with **AdonisJS**, which brings strong conventions and developer-friendly tooling.
- **Rust** is my weapon of choice for systems programming, microservices, and automation tools where memory safety, performance, and reliability are non-negotiable.
- **Dart** and **Flutter** allow me to develop polished mobile interfaces with strong state management and fluid UX, from a single codebase.
