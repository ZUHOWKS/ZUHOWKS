# üëã Hi there!

Hello, I'm **Joris**, an engineering student at Polytech Montpellier, passionate about automation, cloud-native systems, and resilient infrastructure.

I'm committed to delivering reliable, maintainable, and production-ready services, combining technical rigour, a strong sense of quality, and a solid understanding of business needs.

My ambition: keep learning, experimenting, and contributing to projects where automation, scalability, and operational simplicity are top priorities.

## Currently

- ‚öôÔ∏è Automating internal tooling and infrastructure at **Hardis Group**
- üõ† Building CI/CD pipelines with **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and cloud-based container platforms
- üì¶ Developing backends and full-stack systems using **Rust**, **TypeScript**, and **Dart**

## Languages I use

I mainly work with **Rust**, **TypeScript**, and **Dart**, enabling me to create robust, efficient, and maintainable software across platforms.

- **TypeScript**: For expressive web apps and API development ‚Äî I especially enjoy working with **AdonisJS** for its conventions and ergonomics.
- **Rust**: My go-to for performant backend services, automation, and CLI tools where safety and reliability matter.
- **Dart**/**Flutter**: For building polished, cross-platform mobile apps with fast iteration and clean architecture.
